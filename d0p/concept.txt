	Possible command line syntax:

	d0p create package.d0p somefile.txt README.md source.c source.h
		Creates package.d0p with basic header.

	d0p create package.d0p package.d0p.yaml somefile.txt README.md source.c source.h
		the .yaml extension tells d0p that this is the actual header file. 
		The first time a yaml file appears with the same filename as the d0p file, then that is the header to use.
		But since .d0p.yaml is not very often, its pretty sure this is the only time youll need it.
		
	d0p create package.d0p --from-stdin somefile.txt README.md source.c source.h
		Use the YAML specified via stdin.

	d0p add package.d0p newFile.c
		Add a file
		
	d0p delete package.d0p newFile.c
		Delete a file, by its inner path in the archive.
		
	d0p create package.d0p package.yaml -C /home/Ingwie /home/Ingwie/somefile.txt /home/Ingwie/anotherfile.txt
		add somefile.txt and anotherfile.txt to the package.d0p, and treat /home/Ingwie as ./
		I.e.:
			$ d0p list package.d0p
			./somefile.txt
			./anotherfile.txt
			$ d0p create package.d0p package.yaml /home/Ingwie/somefile.txt /home/Ingwie/anotherfile.txt
			$ d0p list package.d0p
			/home/Ingwie/somefile.txt
			/home/Ingwie/anotherfile.txt
		
	d0p explain package.d0p
		Show the internal YAML, to show all the information that the package has.

	d0p xtract package.d0p
		Extract everything from the package. If a file(s) is specified, just that is extracted.
		
	d0p list package.d0p
		List the contents of the inner archive
		
	d0p wrap package.d0p archive.tar.gz archive.yaml
		Wrap the yaml around the archive.
		
	d0p unwrap package.d0p archive.tgz archive.yaml
		Extract the yaml and archive into seperated parts
		
	You can also use single letters as first arguments:
	d0p [a|c|d|e|l|u|x|w] [args...]
	
	If the first argument starts with two dashes instead, they will configure things
	
	d0p --version
	d0p --verbose
	d0p --quiet
	
	By default, d0p is semi-verbose.
	
	$ d0p unwrap package.d0p
	[d0p] Unwrapping into: package.yaml | package.tar.gz
	[d0p] Extracting header... - Done
	[d0p] Extracting Archive... - Done
	
	Note, that the lines are refreshed. This means that you don't have to stare at a big output. However, using --verbose, that'll be turned off.
	
	Example output of file extraction
	$ d0p xtract package.d0p
	[d0p] Obtaining information... - Done
	[d0p: 1/2] somefile.txt
	[d0p: 2/2] /var/log/somelog.log
	
	Example of pretty printing:
	$ d0p --quiet explain package.d0p
